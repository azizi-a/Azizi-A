### Who am I?
I'm an ex physics teacher excited about science, code and people.

After four years of teaching and one of travel I decided to look for a new career where I could better use my problem-solving skills and affinity for technical understanding. Throughout my theoretical physics degree I found the experience of solving problems with code to be one of the most rewarding aspects of study. I decided to develop that by learning full-stack JavaScript development with Founders and Coders.
